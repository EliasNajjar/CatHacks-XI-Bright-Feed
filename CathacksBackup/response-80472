Here are some slightly concerning posts we found!

Iâ€™m at work at 6 am, tired and in a mood. I go to my purse to get my lip balm. And I find the middle is zipped shut. It never is. Iâ€™m a scatter brain who just throws my stuff in there. I was so confused, until I realized it was him. He arranged my wallet and zipped it up in my purse because Iâ€™m always losing it. Heâ€™s always doing things like that. When we eat in the car, my drink will have the straw inside already. When he comes over heâ€™s straightening up my room because heâ€™s tidy and Iâ€™m messy. Consideration. For someone to learn your habits and make an effort to help instead of berate. This is new. But I hope this lasts forever. Iâ€™ve never felt considered like this and no love Iâ€™ve ever ha

Exactly that. Im curious where your hearts lie. Gimme the top 3 (could be 1 or 2 or more than 3 idk just 3 as a ball park) of people you would die for. I heard a beautiful quote from my aunt no less and I love it so much. It goes 'without people to die for, there is no reason to live' and I agree so much to the fullest extent. Its beautiful. So Im just curious who would you guys die for, instantly? Like you dont even have to think about it, whos face is the first one that comes to your head?

For me, instantly its my dog. Thats the first face in my mind right now. It could be pets too of course. Anything you guys want! Where does your love meet sacrifice anything for them if need be? Curious

Iâ€™m losing hope, fast. Iâ€™m doing all the things they say do: working on myself, in therapy, going back to school, blah blah blah. Maybe Iâ€™m just impatient, but Iâ€™ll be 39 this year and I just feel if it hasnâ€™t happened yet then it probably wonâ€™t. Iâ€™m trying to date, but the dating apps are jokes and I donâ€™t meet people while Iâ€™m out and about. I would like to hear from others who were feeling like Iâ€™m feeling, but then love swooped in and washed those feelings away. Iâ€™m a hopeless romantic and I believe Iâ€™m a great partner. I always want to believe love is for me, but the last 7 years have made it difficult.

I mean what's so weird about it, personally i still talk on a nearly daily basis with 2 of my ex's (probably cuz we are in the same school) and both break ups were on peaceful terms(didn't stop me from getting depressed tho lol).but i don't get how SOME people are so fussy about it.

I often see people posting about how much they love their current boyfriend or girlfriend, how they're the one, how they canâ€™t believe someone like that actually exists. And truly, Iâ€™m happy for you all. Butâ€¦

I donâ€™t mean to rain on anyoneâ€™s parade. I just want to gently remind everyone, especially those whoâ€™ve only been in a relationship for less than two years, to keep your eyes wide open and be careful.

Let me tell you a story. A true one. About the greenest guy Iâ€™ve ever heard of, something I learned through my best friend.

My friend had just ended a 7-year relationship because her boyfriend cheated on her. Then she met someone newâ€¦ and this guy completely swept her off her feet.
